Problem Statement: Given two integers, perform the following bitwise operations: AND, OR, and XOR. Return the results of each operation.

ðŸ“Œ Day 14: Array Manipulation

Problem Statement: You are given an array of size n initialized to zeros and a list of operations. Each operation contains three integers: a, b, and k. For each operation, add the value k to all elements of the array between indices a and b (inclusive). Return the maximum value in the array after performing all the operations.

ðŸ“Œ Day 15: Mini-Max Sum

Problem Statement: Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then, print the respective minimum and maximum sums.

ðŸ“Œ Day 16: Time Conversion

Problem Statement: Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to 24-hour military time format. The input is in the format hh:mm:ssAM or hh:mm:ssPM, and the output should be in the formatÂ HH:mm:ss.

ðŸ“Œ Day 17: Grading Students

Problem Statement: If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round the grade up to the next multiple of 5. If the grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs (the grade remains the same).

ðŸ“Œ Day 18: Diagonal Difference

Problem Statement: The primary diagonal is formed by the elements from the top-left to the bottom-right. The secondary diagonal is formed by the elements from the top-right to the bottom-left.

ðŸ“Œ Day 19: Plus Minus

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction to 6 decimal places

ðŸ“Œ Day 20: Recursive Digit Sum

Problem Statement: Given an integer n and a number k, create a new number by concatenating the integer n, k times. Then, find the recursive sum of its digits until a single digit is obtained. Return that single digit.

ðŸ“Œ Day 20: Recursive Digit Sum

Problem Statement: Given an integer n and a number k, create a new number by concatenating the integer n, k times. Then, find the recursive sum of its digits until a single digit is obtained. Return that single digit.

ðŸ“Œ Day 21: Solve Me First

Problem Statement: Given two integers, returnÂ theirÂ sum

ðŸ“Œ Day 22:Cat and Mouse

Problem statement:Two cats and a mouse are at various positions on a line. You will be given their starting positions. Your task is to determine which cat will reach the mouse first, assuming the mouse does not move and the cats travel at equal speed. If the cats arrive at the same time, the mouse will be allowed to move and it will escape while they fight

ðŸ“Œ Day 23:Birthday cake candle

Problem Statement:You are in charge of the cake for a child's birthday. It will have one candle for each year of their total age. They will only be able to blow out the tallest of the candles. Your task is to count how many candles are the tallest.

ðŸ“Œ Day 24:Staircase

Problem Statement:Write a program that prints a staircase of size .

ðŸ“Œ Day 25:Counting Valley

Problem Statement:An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly steps steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, U, or a downhill,D step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a 1 unit changeÂ inÂ altitude

ðŸ“Œ Day 26:Electronic City

Problem Statement:A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items,-1 return .

ðŸ“Œ Day 27: Angry Professor

Problem Statement: A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, the professor decides to cancel class if fewer than some number of students are present when class starts. Arrival times go from on time (arrival time <=0) to arrived late (arrival time>0).

ðŸ“Œ Day 28: Circular Array Rotation

Problem Statement: John Watson knows of an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers. One rotation operation moves the last array element to the first position and shifts all remaining elements right one. To test Sherlock's abilities, Watson provides Sherlock with an array of integers. Sherlock is to perform the rotation operation a number of times then determine the value of the element at a given position.
